    <h2>While Trump downplayed coronavirus, three GOP governors jumped into action</h2>
    <p>
        Donald Trump's admission Monday afternoon that the coronavirus outbreak is "very bad" and the virus is "not under control" marked a stark reversal for the President. Over the past several weeks, Trump consistently downplayed the severity of the outbreak while maintaining that despite mounting evidence to the contrary, the federal government had things well in hand.

        In contrast, several Republican governors who have felt the burden of responding to the growing problem more acutely have taken drastic actions to try to contain the spread of the virus -- implementing emergency restrictions and taking executive actions in line with recommendations from public health officials and experts.

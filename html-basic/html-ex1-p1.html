      <h2>Infected people without symptoms might be driving the spread of coronavirus more than we realized</h2>
      <p>
          New studies in several countries and a large coronavirus outbreak in Massachusetts bring into question reassuring assertions by US officials about the way the novel virus spreads.</p>
      <p>
          These officials have emphasized that the virus is spread mainly by people who are already showing symptoms, such as fever, cough or difficulty breathing. If that's true, it's good news, since people who are obviously ill can be identified and isolated, making it easier to control an outbreak.
          But it appears that a Massachusetts coronavirus cluster with at least 82 cases was started by people who were not yet showing symptoms, and more than half a dozen studies have shown that people without symptoms are causing substantial amounts of infection.

        <h2>While Trump downplayed coronavirus, three GOP governors jumped into action</h2>
        <p>
            Donald Trump's admission Monday afternoon that the coronavirus outbreak is "very bad" and the virus is "not under control" marked a stark reversal for the President. Over the past several weeks, Trump consistently downplayed the severity of the outbreak while maintaining that despite mounting evidence to the contrary, the federal government had things well in hand.
        </p>
        <p>
            In contrast, several Republican governors who have felt the burden of responding to the growing problem more acutely have taken drastic actions to try to contain the spread of the virus -- implementing emergency restrictions and taking executive actions in line with recommendations from public health officials and experts.

        <h2>The global coronavirus recession is beginning</h2>
        <p>
            As restaurants, shops, airlines and factories shut down around the world, from New York to Paris and Madrid, economists are warning that a global recession is no longer a looming threat. It's here.
        </p>
        <p>
            Dire economic data released by China on Monday showed that the country was pummeled by the coronavirus outbreak in January and February. The world's second biggest economy looks unlikely to recover any time soon.
            Now, with governments and central banks in Europe and North America pursuing drastic measures to try to control the pandemic, Asia still on high alert, and financial markets in meltdown, a growing number of experts say that a global contraction is beginning.
